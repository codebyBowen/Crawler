{"text":"Please don't do these mistakes if you're a beginner learning Japanese Hi guys, it's me Judy if you're new to this channel I'm half Japanese and you know, I grew up talking to Japanese and Japanese is my mother tongue today We're going to talk about the most common mistakes that I repeatedly see beginners doing i'm going to explain how to fix those problems Okay, so the first mistake that i've seen so many times and surprises me is that learning Japanese only using Romaji If you don't know Romaji is basically Latin alphabets You might think how am I supposed to learn Japanese without using Latin alphabets? The thing is if you're a complete beginner and if you're like, you know Just started to learn Japanese, of course If you don't know hiragana katakana and kanji the only way for you to read Japanese is using Romaji So the Latin alphabets that's totally fine. But the issue that i've seen is that when you only use Romaji for learning Japanese Because Japanese is not a Romaji based or Latin alphabet based language. The pronunciation is different So how you would pronounce a word using hiragana and katakana versus Romaji is of course will be different And if you will keep using Romaji to learn Japanese with the time you will see that your pronunciation Pronunciation is really different than what Japanese should sound like so my advice will be first Of course in the beginning rely on Romaji that is fine But as soon as possible learn hiragana and katakana, please so that you will learn how to pronounce Japanese words in the correct way Okay, so the second tip or second mistake is not learning kanji This is like a bit tricky problem to be honest because it really depends on your goal If you're learning Japanese only to understand and watch anime, then that's totally fine. Like you don't need to learn kanji That is completely okay but if you're gonna use Japanese in Japan or maybe for your work or Any other thing than only understanding anime or Japanese dramas and music and stuff you need kanji I'm, sorry to tell you but kanji is a huge part of our life in Japan and as a Japanese person, you know Because it's one of the three main alphabets that we have nobody likes kanji except some weirdos I'm, sorry if you like kanji, but I don't like it Anyway, a lot of people try to avoid kanjis when learning Japanese, but kanjis can be really useful You know in day-to-day life in Japan or understanding Japanese texts or understanding Japanese generally you can't skip a whole alphabet I'm, sorry But when learning kanji the most common question that I always always repeatedly get is that how can I learn kanji in a fun way? Or effective way, but I already made a video about it, which you can watch here a detailed video about learning Japanese I always recommend finding a fun way to learn a language because if you're learning a language just for the sake of learning it It kind of feels like work, you know But if you have fun while learning it, it will become much easier for you because it doesn't feel like work anymore So making the process fun is always always always crucial when learning language and for that I recommend today's sponsor Mochi mochi app we collaborated before as I said in the previous video that I made and people really love this So we are collaborating once again because you guys really liked it on mochi mochi app You can learn kanji and also vocabulary using flashcards flashcards are really handy when it comes to learning something When you have a flashcard you think about how can I read this kanji or what is this meaning of this vocabulary? You know you're trying to actively recall and this process is scientifically proven that it's one of the best ways to study And when learning these kanjis and vocabularies another great another scientific proven way to study is space repetition So you basically repeat the things that you learned in intervals? but sometimes a space repetition can be tricky because You might think like when do I need to revise the thing that I learned? Like do I do I need to wait a day three days a week whatever you need to plan when you're gonna revise, right? But on mochi mochi app it's pretty easy because it tells you the golden hour So the best time for you to revise and it reminds you it's time to revise already, you know It's your golden time. Don't miss it type of thing. Not only it reminds you but it also has a really cute interface I think this is one of the things that people really like about mochi mochi is that the interface is so cute You might think this is a really small detail. But as I said alongside like learning language is a whole whole whole Whole journey. It's really long. So when the interface is cute and if you're using it even one percent more because of the cute interface It's a win for us when revising things and when learning things there are five stages of memorization Just because you revise a kanji or vocabulary just once it doesn't mean that it's in your long-term memory, right? So mochi mochi app will categorize you in which stage you are so that you will understand Oh, I revised this thing two times, but it's still not in like stage five or stage I don't know four or something. Maybe I need to revise again So it gives you the clear understanding of how much you memorize of that thing and it will also remind you to when to revise So it's a pretty good thing. You can use this app as a complete and also there is a course list So there are different levels of japanese so you can find your level click there and find the lessons from there Another really handy function is you can listen to pronunciation So when learning a new vocabulary or a new kanji if you don't know how to pronounce it You might pronounce it in the wrong way, but you can listen it and check whether your pronunciation is right I really recommend using mochi mochi app Everything will be linked down description below so that you can download mochi mochi and give it a try. It's free So if you want to learn kanji or generally like in japanese I would highly recommend using mochi mochi because it makes the process much fun and easier for you guys So I would recommend thank you mochi mochi for sponsoring this video Third reason is not having a specific reason actually This is crucial like if you're learning japanese or any other language actually think about it Why are you learning this language? Because depending on your reason depending on your goal the way the method that you use will change If you're learning japanese only for anime, then you can maybe skip kanji You can focus more on the conversations rather than like grammatics and maybe like more complicated Parts of learning japanese, but if you're going to use it for business or maybe for school Then you might want to focus more on grammar or if you just want to use for daily conversation Then maybe you should focus more on daily conversation japanese So if you don't know clearly what your goal when learning japanese is, please stop this video and think about it Why are you learning japanese and create a path create a learning path according to your goal? So another mistake is not doing enough practice with native speakers not doing enough practice with native speakers can be really Tricky because I realize a lot of people only learn japanese through animes or maybe media but the thing is the daily conversation japanese and anime japanese or Any type of media or content is can be really different from each other Because it's made for entertainment purpose and in daily life we use japanese to communicate to understand each other So they have different goals Therefore if you're only learning japanese from anime your japanese can sound a bit weird and I can recognize immediately if that person Learned japanese from anime because it sounds weird if you want to sound natural and if you want to talk like a native speaker You need to practice with native speakers for that. You don't need to do an exchange in japan or something You know, this is the internet era so you can use services apps or I don't know sites to find native speakers in japanese And you can chat with them talk with them You can you know make friends and you can even use like instagram to find people so it shouldn't be that hard You don't need to spend a bunch of money to find japanese native speaker There are so many services out there so you can check them out when talking about sounding natural I think this is also crucial only using textbooks. So I understand to learn grammar and vocabulary Using textbooks can be really handy But if you're only using textbooks when learning a language not only japanese to be honest, it can be problematic Because most of the time textbooks are outdated language is something that lives as I said twice language something lives So since these textbooks are outdated, it might not sound natural, you know in current japan So I would always recommend you to use other sources like mochi mochi and talking to native speakers consuming media And also using textbooks to improve your japanese skills and to sound more natural I feel like this one is not talked about enough. It's not learning the culture I feel like not a lot of people are talking about it when giving language tips language and culture are truly tied together You know, you cannot separate them from each other because in order to understand the language you need to understand the culture as well Especially if you're coming from a very different culture from japan Sometimes when learning a foreign language the rules or the way they say it might not make sense at all Because you have a different reality than japanese people But by understanding the culture and by understanding japanese mentality or the way they think you can actually understand the language even better because from the language you can see the cultural bits of the japanese people and japanese history and Japanese values so I would always always recommend to learn japanese culture if you want to have a deeper Understanding of japanese and I feel like learning the culture is the most fun part of learning a language It's just my personal opinion, but I really love learning other cultures when I was learning german Um learning the german culture really allows you to understand the german language and how they phrase things So I would recommend to learn japanese. I would highly recommend you to learn japanese culture It's unique like every other culture out there. So just learn it, you know It really broadens up your vision and gives you new values because there is no right or wrong in this world They're just different values according to different cultures and different ways of understanding. I recommend so the last one Especially if you're watching this video is looking for the perfect method to look for the fastest way to learn japanese, you know I understand learning a language is a very long journey So sometimes we want to use shortcuts and we want to find a perfect way so that we can make sure that we're learning In the fastest pace, you know, but the important thing is enjoying the journey Of course, you need to try new methods because everybody learns in a different way the method that works for me might not work for you So yes I'm giving like these tips But you can try out and find out what works for you and in order to find out the best method that works for you You need to give the method a bit of time, you know, you need to trust the process Because just because you tried the method for a week and you didn't learn that much It doesn't mean that it doesn't work for you You know, you need to give a bit of time Maybe I don't know two to three months and then give yourself an honest feedback. Is this method working for me? Is this an efficient way to learn the language with the feedback think about it? What can I improve about this method or maybe this is not the way that I want to learn a language? I don't enjoy it even though it's effective. It might not be really fun. So think about it How can I make it more fun more enjoyable? It's a long journey So you need to have a patience but also give yourself an honest feedback each time. Is this working for me?
